this project is about blinking one led every 1 sec

it uses timer 0
system clock = 4 MHz
prescaller = 8

and the led is in PORTA pin 0

note that:
in case of polling, we diable interrupt of the timer and also no need for global interrupt

and we poll on interrupt flag,
the flag that is set to one when timer overflows
it's the same flag in case of interrupt and polling
